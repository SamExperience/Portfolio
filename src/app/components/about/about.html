        I'm a Junior Full-Stack Developer specializing in modern, responsive web applications built
        with Angular and TypeScript on the front end, and Node.js + Express on the back end. I
        combine component-driven UI development, SCSS and accessibility best practices with solid
        backend skills (REST APIs and relational/NoSQL databases) to deliver clean, maintainable and
        high-performing solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        My workflow relies on TypeScript, Git, basic unit testing and containerization (Docker). I
        love solving problems and learning continuously â€” I bring resilience, focus and a practical
        delivery mindset to every project. Outside of work I build personal projects and attend
        local tech meetups to grow and share knowledge with the community.
