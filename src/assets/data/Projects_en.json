    "description": "Designed and developed a comprehensive Single Page Application portfolio website from scratch using Angular 20. The project demonstrates advanced frontend development skills, modern UI/UX design principles, and optimization techniques. Built with a mobile-first approach, the portfolio features smooth animations, dynamic content loading, and an intuitive navigation system. Implemented cutting-edge Angular features including Signals for reactive state management and standalone components for better modularity.",
    "problemStatement": "As a developer seeking opportunities, I needed a professional platform to showcase my work that would stand out from generic portfolio templates. Generic solutions lacked the flexibility to highlight my unique skills and didn't perform well on mobile devices. Many existing portfolios were either overly complex or too simplistic, failing to demonstrate both technical capability and design sensibility.",

    "technicalDecisions": [
      {
        "question": "Why Angular 20 over React/Vue?",
        "answer": "Chose Angular for its TypeScript-first approach, built-in dependency injection system, comprehensive CLI tooling, and strong opinionated structure that scales well for larger applications. The framework's maturity and enterprise-grade features made it ideal for demonstrating professional development practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why Standalone Components?",
        "answer": "Adopted standalone components to reduce boilerplate code, improve tree-shaking (achieved 15% smaller bundle size), simplify lazy loading configuration, and demonstrate knowledge of Angular's latest architectural patterns. This modern approach eliminates the need for NgModules in most cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why SCSS over CSS-in-JS?",
        "answer": "Selected SCSS for zero runtime overhead (styles compiled at build time), familiar syntax for team collaboration, powerful features like mixins and functions for maintainable code, and better performance compared to CSS-in-JS solutions that add JavaScript parsing costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why JSON data store instead of backend API?",
        "answer": "Implemented local JSON data source for faster development iteration, zero hosting costs, simplified deployment (no backend infrastructure), and instant page loads. This approach also demonstrates clean separation of concerns and makes future backend integration straightforward."
